# Version 2: Make it scalable
# Make a copy of your entire tic_tac_toe_v1 directory and rename it tic_tac_toe_v2. 
# Open the version 2 in your editor and terminal so we can refactor it to support 
# more features. This will be our new working directory.

# Our goal for this version is to make the game scale on two fronts:

# support a dynamic board size
# support more than two players
# Board size refactor
# We need to change a few things to support any size board. We'll mention a few 
# general todos, but you may need to change more if you hard-coded a 3x3 size in 
# your first iteration.

# Board#initialize
# Refactor this method to accept a number argument, n. The grid should be set to a 
# 2-dimensional array with size 'n x n', instead of '3 x 3'. It's worth noting that 
# the grid will always be a square (meaning its height is equal to its width). This 
# will somewhat simplify things as we refactor our other methods.

# Consider refactoring these critical board 
# methods if they contain any hardcoded values:

# #valid?
# #print
# #win_row?
# #win_col?
# #win_diagonal
# #win?
# #empty_positions?
# Checkpoint - Test the fruits of your labor(ed)
# Load board.rb using pry. Create different sized boards and invoke all board 
# methods on them. Here are our initial tests, but you should be much more thorough:

# [1] pry(main)> load 'board.rb'
# => true

# [2] pry(main)> small = Board.new(4)
# => #<Board:0x
#  @grid=[
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_"]]
#    >

# [3] pry(main)> large = Board.new(6)
# => #<Board:0x
#  @grid=
#   [["_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"],
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"],
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"],
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"],
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"],
#    ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_", "_"]]>

# [4] pry(main)> small.valid?([3, 3])
# => true

# [5] pry(main)> small.valid?([5, 5])
# => false

# [6] pry(main)> large.valid?([5, 5])
# => true
# Game#initialize
# Refactor this method to also accept a number for the board size as the first argument.

# That should be all we need to refactor, since we designed our version 1 to avoid 
# as much coupling to Board as possible. However, take a moment to scan the rest 
# of your Game and HumanPlayer class to be sure.

# Use pry to play a few games of varying size to completion before continuing further.

# Number of players refactor
# Adding support for any number of players should require a decent refactor of the 
# Game class, but no major changes to HumanPlayer. The only logic that should change 
# is how we decide which player should move, but the capabilities of any single 
# player remains unchanged.

# Game#initialize
# An instance of Game will now need to track an array of many players instead of 
# just two. Make this an instance variable. Allow your #initialize to accept any 
# number of mark values. The number of marks passed to #initialize will decide how 
# many players are in the game.

# Game#switch_turn
# For our switching logic, we'll use a "Round Robin" strategy. This means that 
# players continually take turns in the same order. For example, if we had players 
# A, B, and C, then the turns would be ABCABCABC... until the game is over.

# For simplicity, we'll always designate whoever is at the front of the array as 
# the current player. Consider using Array#rotate! to accomplish this.

# Test the switching logic in isolation using pry. Here is how our class works:

# [1] pry(main)> load 'game.rb'
# => true

# [2] pry(main)> g = Game.new(4, 'A', 'B', 'C')
# => #<Game:0x
#  @board=
#   #<Board:0x
#    @grid=[["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#           ["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#           ["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#           ["_", "_", "_", "_"]]>,
#  @current_player=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="A">,
#  @players=
#   [#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="A">,
#    #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="B">,
#    #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="C">]>

# [3] pry(main)> g.switch_turn
# => #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="B">

# [4] pry(main)> g.switch_turn
# => #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="C">

# [5] pry(main)> g
# => #<Game:0x
#  @board=
#   #<Board:0x
#    @grid=[["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#           ["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#           ["_", "_", "_", "_"],
#           ["_", "_", "_", "_"]]>,
#  @current_player=#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="C">,
#  @players=
#   [#<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="C">,
#    #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="A">,
#    #<HumanPlayer:0x @mark="B">]>
# After you see that the current player is switching properly, you should be able 
# to play your game! Play a few rounds of varying size for good measure. 
# Pretty neat, huh?
